# CARaDOC website

## Quick Start

If you already have **jekyll** installed, you can just copy/paste and run the following lines :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/atacs-centralesupelec/caradoc.git
cd caradoc
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## For installing Jekyll

Follow the steps proposed by the official Jekyll website. You will be asked to install **ruby** as well.

[Official Jekyll Installation Guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

## Updating gems

On macos, `jekyll` recommends to use `chruby`. `chruby` detects automatically the required version of ruby, by looking into the file `.ruby-version` in the project root folder.

## For developers

If you want to contibute to the project, have a look at the project wiki.

You will also need to be authorized to write on the repository by one of the repository owners.
